Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application is to have an admin who can maintain the website and have users who can contribute to the library itself. 
- a challenge i ran into when realizing this website was how identify each book as unique. 
- The authentication strategy i chose to use was passport because it seemed the easiest to implement. 
- For my css framework, I used bootstrap.
- I created the button customization. 
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does.
    - passport : used to authentiate logins
    - bodyParser : parses json objects
    - cookieParser : parses cookie with each session
    - errorhandler : handles processing errors 
    - cookiesession : simplify certain load-balanced scenarios
